This lesson teaches participants how to collaborate with git and GitHub in one day. 

## Teaching a 2-day Good practices in research software development workshop
Often we also add a 2nd day with this lesson: https://esciencecenter-digital-skills.github.io/good-practices-lesson/, 
which builds out the basis of git and GitHub to a 2-day Good practices in research sofware development workshop

## Timing
It is quite ambitious to teach git and GitHub properly in one day. 
Here are some tips to make it work:
- **Park advanced questions** In the 'introduction to git' part: ignore the temptation to answer advanced questions. 
(You can of course do this individually during exercises). 
- **Focus on the bare minimum** There is so much to explain about git, 
but focus on the bare minimum that participants need to be able to collaborate on GitHub.
